  <h3>Project Proposal</h3> <br>

<h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>Hi, My name is Achintya and I'm a high school student residing in the state of Massachusetts. I am 16 years old, have never skateboarded ever, and love to eat Mexican food. My favorite movie is "The Pursuit of Happyness" and my favorite TV show is "The Office". I have many interests, including sports, airplanes, and of course physics. Most of my interest in Physics comes from my intrigue in understanding and wanting to further learn about how airplanes do what they do. However, I am interested in other aspects of Physics as well.</p>


<h3>What My Project is going to be About</h3>
   <p>For this year's Digital Fabrication Project, I'm planning on creating a noise-cancelling head/ear phone/plug/pod that will sense any external sound stimuli and produce opposite crescent/trough waves of equal amplitude, wavelength and frequency in order to negate any sound that will be heard by the wearer. Also, I'm planning on possibly incorporating a way for that ear device to sense pulse rate throughout the sleep period and in a computer program, record the pulse activity and determine when the user entered and exited Deep Sleep and possibly other sleep phases</p>
