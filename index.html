<h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>Hi, My name is Achintya and I'm a high school student residing in the state of Massachusetts. I am 16 years old, an avid Celtics and Patriots fan, and love to eat Mexican food. My favorite movie is "The Pursuit of Happyness" and my favorite TV show is "The Office". I have many interests, including sports, airplanes, and of course physics. Most of my interest in Physics comes from my intrigue in understanding and wanting to further learn about how airplanes do what they do. I am also interested in other aspects of Physics as well.</p>

<h3>What My Project is going to be About</h3>
   <p>For this year's Digital Fabrication Project, I'm planning on creating a noise-cancelling head/ear phone/plug/pod that will sense any external sound stimuli and produce opposite crescent/trough waves of equal amplitude, wavelength and frequency in order to negate any sound that will be heard by the wearer. Also, I'm planning on possibly incorporating a way for that ear device to sense pulse rate throughout the sleep period and in a computer program, record the pulse activity and determine when the user entered and exited Deep Sleep and possibly other sleep phases</p>
        
      <h3>Using Fusion 360</h3>
    <p>During the second part of Week 1, we got introduced to the Fusion 360 Program and were instructed to view a couple of tutorials and follow them as per, on the program, as way to develop our learning and skill relating to the use of Fusion 360. 

      The first tutorial I watched was made by a Youtube account by the name "CAD CAM Tutorial". By following this tutorial, I learned how to insert a line, and then using certain mouse inputs, stem out additional lines and arcs. Using the Sketch Dimension option under the "Create" sub-tab in the "Sketch" Tab, I was able to alter the specific lines and arcs to the dimensions I inputted (typed). The end result was I had a closed polygonic image. 

      I then further experimented with some of the features of Fusion. I pressed "Finish Sketch", to complete the outline of my object. Then, I was able to Extrude my object, making it 20 millimeters thick. I also experimented with the "Create Form" option where I pressed the "Create cylinder" option. I had to then create a circle within the polygonic structure I had created, after which an open cylindrical extrusion (very short in length/height) appeared on the object. 

      I then, like previously learned, saved and titled the Design and placed it into my "Press Fit" Folder under the Project Name "Press"</p>
